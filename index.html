								<b>I am a joined astronomer (astronome-adjointe) at the Observatory of Strasbourg since 2009. This means that I do research (on dust in nearby galaxies), I have service duties (at CDS) and I teach at the university of Strasbourg.</b>
							</p>		
						
								
								<!-- Items contained in <b> tags are bolded! -->
								Education: I did my early physics studies at the Universite de Bretagne Sud in Britanny, on the west coast of France. <br>
								I then did my master at the university of Strasbourg and was a PhD student between the Observatory of Strasbourg and Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay under the supervision of Daniel Egret and Francois Boulanger. <br>
								I then went for a post-doc at IPAC, Caltech with George Helou on Spitzer data and came back for a CNES post-doc at the Observatory of Strasbourg.
